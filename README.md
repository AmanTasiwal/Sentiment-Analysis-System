The main aim of this research is to classify whether movie reviews express positive or negative sentiment. It will require transforming raw text into neat and structured text, extracting certain features and building neural networks on it using Python languages with libraries such as NLTK and TensorFlow/Keras. This platform processes the reviews by breaking the sentences into words with special meaning ,some of which are discarded; while the remainder are lemmatized. Transformation from sentences into numerical forms occurs through Tokenizer module in Keras, after which LSTM neural network models are constructed and trained.
