This work entails the classification process where one seeks to classify the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative. Cleaning the textual data and then feature extraction and training a neural network model using Python, NLTK and TensorFlow or Keras. The system then extracts the reviews and preprocesses them through tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming. It then processes the textual data into numerical features with the help of Keras Tokenizer. The classification is performed using an LSTM neural network model that is trained. The performance of the model is then evaluated using common metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This work shows how NLP and deep learning techniques can be applied in practice for sentiment analysis while providing a great foundation for further research.
